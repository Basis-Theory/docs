The Basis Theory API is organized around REST. Our API was built with a predictiable resource-oriented strucutre, use JSON-encoded request and responses, have tightly follow HTTP verbs/responses, and industry standard authentication.

You are able to create different tenants within your Basis Theory account to enable you to segment your test environments from your core production data. These tenants will serve as a logically grouping for each of your systems to interact with Basis theory without affecting eachother.

## What is Basis Theory?
Our software becomes a core part of your infrastructure enabling you to quickly encrypt, tokenize, and store any payload securely. Your token infrastructure can be used to protect data at rest, as it passes between your own internal systems, or as itâ€™s permissioned and shared with third parties.
