# Getting started
## Before you begin
### If you don't have an account

Currently, Basis Theory is in private beta, you can join our waitlist at https://basistheory.com and we will let you know when we are accepting new applicants.

To begin taking advantage of the Basis Theory platform, you’ll need to create an account and tenant through our [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com). This will enable you to manage your token data, create new applications, and authenticate to our API.

### If you have an account
