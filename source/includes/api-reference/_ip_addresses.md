# IP Addresses

Basis Theory hosts its systems in multiple regions, but utilizes a list of static IP addresses for all outbound network traffic that your systems and firewalls can whitelist for inbound traffic.
These IP addresses are static - we will make the best effort to attempt to give **30-day** notifications to changes to this list.
The following is a list of IP addresses by region for Basis Theory systems:

## North America
