The Basis Theory API is organized around REST. Our API is built with a predictable resource-oriented structure, uses JSON-encoded requests and responses, follows standard HTTP verbs/responses, and uses industry standard authentication.

You are able to create different [Tenants](#tenants) within your Basis Theory account to enable you to segment your test environments from your core production data. Tenants serve as a logical grouping for each of your systems to interact with Basis Theory without affecting each other.

## What is Basis Theory?
Our software becomes a core part of your infrastructure enabling you to quickly encrypt, tokenize, and store any payload securely. Your token infrastructure can be used to protect data at rest, as it passes between your own internal systems, or how it's permissioned and shared with third parties.
