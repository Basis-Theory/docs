# Aliasing

By default, when [creating a token](/#tokens-create-token), a random id (v4 UUID) will be generated to represent the
token and its secure payload. Token ids can be safely stored within your system or transmitted within API requests
without the risk of revealing sensitive information.

While randomly generated ids may be sufficient for many use cases, we have seen several scenarios in which it can be
valuable for a generated token id to satisfy a specific format, or to allow a custom token id to be specified within
the request:

- You would like the id to resemble the format of the underlying token data (e.g. to satisfy validation constraints)
- Due to technical constraints, your system requires the token id to have a prescribed size or format (e.g. to store the
  id within a legacy database column having a certain data type)
- You wish to pre-generate token ids within your system
- You wish to define your own custom algorithm for generating token ids

Basis Theory supports these use cases in two ways:

1. Accepting a [predefined token id](#aliasing-pre-defined-token-ids) when creating a token
2. Specifying how an id should be generated through the use of [Alias Expressions](#aliasing-alias-expressions)

## Predefined Token Ids

A token id can be pre-generated by your system and provided when [creating a token](/#tokens-create-token)
within the `id` property. Any non-empty string value between 3 and 400 characters can be specified as an id, as long as
there is not another token within your tenant with the same id. If a duplicate id is found, a `409 CONFLICT` 
response will be returned.

## Alias Expressions

Alias expressions allow you to leverage the full [expression language](#language) to specify a token's id via a
dynamically evaluated expression, and can be provided within the `id` property of the
[create token](/api-reference/#tokens-create-token) or [tokenize](/api-reference/#tokenize) requests.

You are able to reference the `data` property within an [object](#language-objects) expression -
`data` will be bound to the provided token data.

Typically, alias expressions are used in conjunction with one of the `alias_*` filters (e.g. [alias_preserve_format](#filters-alias_preserve_format)
or [alias_preserve_length](#filters-alias_preserve_length)). These filters randomly generate a secure pseudonym based off the token's data.
For example, if a token contains the credit card number `4242-4242-4242-4242`, the alias expression `{{ data | alias_preserve_format: 0, 4 }}`
could be used to reveal the last 4 digits in the id with random digits replacing all the other non-revealed digits, 
resulting in an id of the form `9326-7128-4203-4242`.

<aside class="warning">
  <span>
    The number of randomly generated aliases satisfying a certain format is finite and has a chance to become exhausted. 
    If a unique alias cannot be generated, a randomly generated UUID will be returned instead.

</aside>

## Best Practices

While you have the ability to set any value as a token's id, you should never reveal sensitive information in the `id` of your token.
Token ids are not encrypted and will be revealed in plaintext within API requests and responses, and likely referenced within your systems.

Only reveal characters at the beginning or end of your token data if absolutely necessary, and if so, reveal the minimum number of characters possible.
Every revealed character makes it easier for a malicious actor to try to uncover the underlying token's data. 
For example, given a 16 digit credit card number, revealing the first 6 and last 4 characters in a format preserving alias
only leaves 6 remaining digits (10^6 = 1 million possible combinations), which can be reduced further
knowing that the card number must have a valid Luhn checksum. 

Special characters and whitespace characters are accepted within ids, but they will need to be url encoded within
requests where the id is provided within the API route. The latest official Basis Theory SDKs automatically url encode 
token ids when included in the url. To take advantage of this feature, ensure you are using at least the following versions of each SDK:

| SDK                | Min Version |
|--------------------|-------------|
| basistheory-dotnet | todo        |
| basistheory-go     | todo        |
| basistheory-js     | todo        |
| basistheory-python | todo        |


## Examples

- [SSN with Last 4 Digits Preserved](#aliasing-examples-ssn-with-last-4-digits-preserved)
- [Card Number with Last 4 Digits Preserved](#aliasing-examples-card-number-with-last-4-digits-preserved)
- [Email with Domain Preserved](#aliasing-examples-email-with-domain-preserved)

### SSN with Last 4 Digits Preserved

Request:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```json
{
  "id": "{{ data | alias_preserve_format: 0, 4 }}",
  "type": "token",
  "data": "111-22-3333"
}
```

Example Id Value: `830-46-3333`

### Card Number with Last 4 Digits Preserved

Request:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```json
{
  "id": "{{ data.number | alias_preserve_format: 0, 4 }}",
  "type": "card",
  "data": {
    "number": "4242424242424242",
    "expiration_month": 3,
    "expiration_year": 2025,
    "cvc": "456"
  }
}
```

Example Id Value: `9273610263384242`

### Email with Domain Preserved

This example assumes you do not know the length of the email domain, and want to preserve arbitrary domains.

Request:

<div class="center-column"></div>
```json
{
  "id": "{{ data.email | split: '@' | first | alias_preserve_length }}@{{ data.email | split: '@' | last }}",
  "type": "token",
  "data": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@gmail.com"
  }
}
```

Example Id Value: `k7dn59wb@gmail.com`

If you know the length of the domain ahead of time, you can simplify this expression by revealing the number of 
characters in the domain, e.g. `{{ data.email | alias_preserve_length: 0, 10 }}`.
