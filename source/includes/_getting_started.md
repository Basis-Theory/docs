# Getting Started

To get started using Basis Theory to tokenize any data, an [Application](#applications) needs to be created to obtain an [API Key](#authentication).
To do so, log in or create an account through the Basis Theory <a href="https://portal.basistheory.com/" target="_blank">Portal</a>.
Then proceed to the <a href="https://portal.basistheory.com/applications" target="_blank">Applications</a> page and click `Create Application`.
Follow the on-screen prompts to name the application and choose the appropriate [Application Type](#application-types) based on your use-case.

After creating the application and acknowledging the API Key prompt, a redirect will happen to view the newly created application details.
Next, we need to assign the necessary permissions to the created Application. More information about Permission Types can be found [here](#permission-types).

<aside class="notice">
If a Basis Theory API responds with <code>403 FORBIDDEN</code>, it is likely due to the application lacking the appropriate permissions to invoke that endpoint.
