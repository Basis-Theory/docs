# Getting started
## Before you begin
### If you don't have an account

Currently, Basis Theory is in private beta, you can join our waitlist at https://basistheory.com and we will let you know when we are accepting new applicants.

To begin taking advantage of the Basis Theory platform, you’ll need to create an account and tenant through our [Portal](https://portal.basistheory.com). This will enable you to manage your token data, create new applications, and authenticate to our API.

### If you have an account

Checkout out our API Reference documentation below, or go to our Getting Started section if you’re unsure of where to go next.

## Install SDK

> NPM
```shell
npm install --save @Basis-Theory/basis-theory-js
```

> Yarn
```shell
yarn add @Basis-Theory/basis-theory-js
```

> CDN
```jsx
<script src="https://js.basistheory.com"></script> 
```

You don't have to install **Elements** as a separated module or include additional script tags besides **BasisTheory.js**. It will dynamically load them from our secure domain, which enables us to keep the highest compliance standards (e.g. PCI compliance).

To install **BasisTheory.js** you can choose either our NPM module or CDN hosted bundle through a `script` tag.
