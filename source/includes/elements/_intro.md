**BasisTheory Elements** are simple, secure, developer-friendly inputs that empower consumers to collect sensitive data from their users directly to Basis Theory certified vault.

Think about it as a portal that we open within your site that allows users to seamlessly tokenize information and never notice they are interacting with our technology. Here is how we make it possible:

- We allow you to own your UX, by fully customizing how **elements** will look like;
- Inputs and forms are simple to use, yet we enable you to interact with them similar to how you do with native elements, so you never lose track of your users;
