**Basis Theory Elements** are simple, secure, developer-friendly inputs that empower consumers to collect and reveal sensitive data from/to their users directly to/from a Basis Theory certified vault.

Think about it as a portal that we open within your site that allows users to seamlessly tokenize information and never notice they are interacting with our technology. Here is how we make it possible:

- Own your UX, by fully customizing how **Elements** are styled
- Inputs and forms are simple to use
- Able to interact with Elements as you do with native elements

**Reveal Sensitive Data**
