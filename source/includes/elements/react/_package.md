**Basis Theory React** is an [open source](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basis-theory-react) [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@basis-theory/basis-theory-react) designed to allow you to easily integrate Basis Theory SDK and Elements features in your React solution.

Under this section, you can find out how to initialize and access `BasisTheory` instance using <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" target="_blank">Hooks</a>, pass it through your component tree with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" target="_blank">Context</a> and declare Elements <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html" target="_blank">Component</a> in your code. 

Creating, mounting, updating and unmounting elements is as simple as declaring their tags and passing props.

  <span>You don't have to install <code>@basis-theory/basis-theory-js</code> separately when using our React package, unless you need to direct import something from it.</span>
