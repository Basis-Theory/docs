**Basis Theory React** is an [open source](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basis-theory-react) [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@basis-theory/basis-theory-react) designed to allow you to easily integrate Basis Theory SDK and Elements features in your React based solution.

Under this section, you can find out how to initialize and access `BasisTheory` instance using [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), pass it through your component tree with [Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and use Elements in declarative approach.
