## Coming Soon

<aside class="notice">
  <span>Our native Android SDK is currently in early access. Interested? Email us at <a href="mailto:info@basistheory.com?subject=Android SDK Early Access Request">info@basistheory.com</a></span>

You can utilize the Basis Theory Android SDK to collect sensitive data within your native Android app while keeping your app 
out of compliance scope. Our SDK provides components and services that enable your app to securely collect and tokenize
sensitive data without needing to interact directly with the data.

Come back soon to see our complete docs.

## Java SDK

We also provide a [Java SDK](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-java) that can be used from 
within either Java or Kotlin based Android apps. While this SDK won't keep your app completely out of compliance 
scope while collecting sensitive data, it can simplify your integration with the Basis Theory API. 
See the [README](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-java) for installation and usage instructions.
