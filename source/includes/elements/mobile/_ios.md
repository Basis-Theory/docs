## Coming Soon

<aside class="notice">
  <span>Our native iOS SDK is currently in early access. Interested? Email us at <a href="mailto:info@basistheory.com?subject=iOS SDK Early Access Request">info@basistheory.com</a></span>

You can utilize the Basis Theory iOS SDK to collect sensitive data within your native iOS app while keeping your app
out of compliance scope. Our SDK provides components and services that enable your app to securely collect and tokenize
sensitive data without needing to interact directly with the data.

Come back soon to see our complete installation and usage docs.

## Swift SDK

We also provide a [Swift SDK](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-swift) that can be used from
within a native Swift-based iOS app. While this SDK won't keep your app completely out of compliance
scope while collecting sensitive data, it can simplify your integration with the Basis Theory API. 
See the [README](https://github.com/Basis-Theory/basistheory-swift) for installation and usage instructions.
