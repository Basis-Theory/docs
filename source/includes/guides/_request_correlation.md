# Request correlation

Basis Theory utilizes Correlation IDs to assist with request tracing, logging, and debugging.

All API endpoints accepts a client-provided Correlation ID if sent with the `bt-trace-id` HTTP header within POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE methods.

If a `bt-trace-id` Correlation ID is not provided by the client, a new Correlation ID will be generated by the Basis Theory API.
