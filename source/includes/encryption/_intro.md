Basis Theory Encryption provides a secure and developer-friendly way for consumers to control their data encryption.
Our SDKs support multiple ways to manage your own encryption and those encryption keys, so only you can see your data.
If you want step by step instructions on how to own your encryption and plug it back into our platform check out our official [guide](https://guides.basistheory.com/guides/own-your-encryption-keys/).
