# Introduction

Welcome to the Basis Theory API! You can use our API to access Basis Theory API endpoints, which can get information on managing your tokens.

We have language examples in Shell and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
